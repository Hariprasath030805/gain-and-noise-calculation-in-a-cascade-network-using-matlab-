This project aims to develop a MATLAB script that calculates the gain and noise of a cascade network. The script uses the concepts of signal processing and noise analysis to determine the overall gain and noise of the network.

A script main.m is created to get input and call the function (mycalc.m) for each stage.

A user-defined function called mycalc.m is created.

The function gets an argument:

1.The amplifier's gain

2.The amplifier's noise figure

3.The amplifier's noise temperature

4.Total noise temperature of the amplifier

5.Product of each gain of the amplifier

6.In which stageÂ 

The function returns:

1.The total gain up to that stage

2.The total noise figure up to that stage

3.The total noise temperature up to that stage

4.The product of gain up to that stage
